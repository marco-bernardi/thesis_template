\chapter{Attacks Frameworks}
\label{Attacks Frameworks}

Evaluating the robustness of collaborative perception systems requires the design of structured and reproducible attack frameworks.
These frameworks provide a controlled method for introducing perturbations, allowing researchers to measure performance degradation under adversarial conditions and to identify the vulnerabilities being exploited.

In this work, we categorise attack strategies into two main classes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Human understandable attacks: adversarial manipulations that are perceptible to human observers and physically embedded in the driving environment.
    \item Non-human understandable attacks: perturbations that are imperceptible or unintuitive to humans, typically applied directly in the digital domain, such as pixel-level noise or feature-space perturbations.
\end{itemize}
Studying both categories allows us to analyse the difference between physical-world manipulations and digital perturbations, and to observe how each type affects collaborative perception systems.
In particular, human understandable attacks are relevant for real-world deployment scenarios, while non-human understandable attacks target the algorithmic vulnerabilities of the perception models themselves.
Evaluating both provides a broader view of the potential attack surface.

\section{Human Understandable Attacks}

In our work, human understandable attacks focus on manipulating the physical environment to deceive perception systems.
These attacks leverage the use of adversarial patches, designed to represent an object of interest, such as a pedestrian or a vehicle, to mislead the perception model into misclassifying or overlooking the object.
For example, an image resembling a car printed on a billboard can create false positives or suppress true detections, leading to potentially dangerous situations on the road.

These patches are adapted to the surface where they will be placed, taking into account viewing angles and distances to maximise their effectiveness.
Once created, they are physically positioned in the environment, for example on a billboard, wall, or directly on the ground.
Because this approach requires limited technical expertise, it is accessible to a wide range of potential adversaries.

In our experiments, this attack type was subcategorised into \textit{vertical} and \textit{horizontal} attacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vertical attacks}: the patch is placed on a vertical surface, such as a wall or billboard next to the road lane.
    \item \textbf{Horizontal attacks}: the patch is placed on the ground in front of the vehicle, ensuring that it is captured by the sensors and shared in the collaborative network.
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:horizontal_attack}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:vertical_attack} and \ref{fig:horizontal_attack} illustrate the different setups, highlighting the strategic placement of adversarial patches to mislead perception systems.

\subsection{Patch the Environment}

For the tests conducted in the physical setups (both indoor and outdoor), the adversarial patches were physically placed within the environment.
For the experiments carried out in CARLA, we modified the \texttt{Town06} map by adding these patches at different locations.

To evaluate the attack’s effectiveness, we varied both the size of the patch and its placement within the scene.
In particular, we positioned the patch at different distances from the road to assess how spatial location influences detection performance.

\section{Non-Human Understandable Attacks}

Non-human understandable attacks introduce perturbations into perception system inputs that remain imperceptible to human observers while still inducing erroneous predictions.
These are subtle, carefully designed modifications to the input data that exploit the model’s learned decision boundaries.

A common approach in this category is the generation of \textit{adversarial examples} using gradient-based optimisation methods, such as the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).
These produce small perturbations that can lead to misclassifications, bounding box shifts, or missed detections, despite their minimal magnitude.

In our study, we explored the feasibility of applying such perturbations to the CoBEVT model by integrating generated patches directly into the input data.
Evaluation was based on the change in \textit{Intersection over Union} (IoU) between predictions on patched inputs and predictions on clean inputs.
This choice of metric allowed us to quantify the extent to which the patch altered the perceived scene.

\subsection{Patch Generator}

For this category, we developed an adversarial patch generator in a \textit{black-box} setting, optimising solely based on the perception system’s output without access to its internal parameters.
The generator was a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) suitable for iterative optimisation.

\subsubsection{Training Objective and Process}

The objective was to maximise the misclassification rate by minimising the IoU between the predicted mask and the ground truth mask:

\[
    \mathcal{L} = 1 - \frac{|P \cap G|}{|P \cup G|}
\]
where \(P\) is the set of predicted pixels and \(G\) the set of ground truth pixels.

Training began with a \(40 \times 40\) pixel patch placed in the lower region of the front camera frames.
The perception model’s segmentation output was compared to the ground truth, and the resulting loss \(\mathcal{L}\) was backpropagated to update the patch generator.
Over iterations, the generator adapted to produce patterns that progressively reduced IoU.
